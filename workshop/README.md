### How to Get Started

1. Download "starter.html" and "cheese_engineers.csv" and save it in a folder
2. Use Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (PC), which both represent the command line, and you'll want to go to the folder you added the files to.
	* For both Macs and PCs, you'll use the ```cd``` command 
3. Once there, start a local server 
	* For Macs, you can simply do: ``` python -m http.server 8000 ``` if using python 3; ``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` if using python 2
	* For PCs, it's a bit more complicated. You'll need to either download python or XAMPP. You can checkout [this page](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
4. Go to your browser (Chrome is recommended), and go to this URL ```localhost:8000```
